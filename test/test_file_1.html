<PRE CLASS="western">Tensleep Corporation (Other OTC:TENS.PK - News) (&quot;Tensleep&quot;) announced that with the acquisition of XSTV Media, Inc. (&quot;XSTV&quot;),
                                                                                                         it will become an online independent sports company. The transaction is
to close on or before September 15, 2007. Tensleep will, by the end of
this week or early next week, call a special meeting of shareholders to
approve the change name to &quot;XSTV Corporation.&quot;

David Bailey, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison who can be contacted at david at bailey dot com, said such cuts &quot;could include head count reductions.&quot;
Layoffs to some degree are inevitable, said IDC analyst Roger Kay. For years,
                                                                       the company enjoyed a lower cost structure than other PC makers because
it sold computers directly.
                      International Star Inc. (info@ITSR.com - OTC BB: ILST) announced that the annual meeting of
shareholders of International Star Inc. will be held on May 19, 2008,
                                                            at 3:00 p.m. (local time) at The Hilton Hotel, 104 Market Street,
                                                                                                                      Shreveport, La., 71101.   </PRE>
